# Game Creation Tutorial
A short and simple tutorial for programming a 2D game in lua using love.

This tutorial contains our current progress in the club, and should be referenced if
you feel you are behind, are confused about the meaning of certain lines of code, or are just starting.

To catch up, copy the contents of the main.lua file above into your main.lua,
or alternatively click the button to the right to download everything into
a zip file and unzip that in your game's directory.

If you have any questions, you can email me at webmasterjake@comcast.net
